### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hey there, myself Sayad Pervez. 
A tech enthusiast who aspires to create **"ðŸ¤©coolðŸ˜Ž"** futuristic technologies that I would like to have in my life. 

"A dream isn't something you see while sleeping; it's something that keeps you awake," said our former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. And just like that, the journey towards my dream began after my 10th grade when I started learning Python and Arduino. Right from the start, I prioritized working on projects and applying the concepts that I learnt which sets me apart from the rest.

Having a wide-field of interest in both Programming and Electronics, I chose Electronics and Communication Engineering as my UG course particularly because I was confident in my programming skills and believed I could excel in programming on my own ( NO REGRETS ).

I am currently an ECE Engineer and a self-taught Programmer with good knowledge and experience, and I am eager to learn more and create awesome tools, gadgets, and software. All of my projects are listed on my personal website/portfolio, and majority of them are open source and available on GitHub.

My hobbies include swimming, astro-photography, bird watching, motor-cycling and trekking.
